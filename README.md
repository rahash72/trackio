## About the Project

Anemo has been designed with the purpose of helping students in a campus connect with each other.<br />
- It gives you the feature of an inclusive micro-blogging site where you can add your own posts and also interact with
the posts of other students by liking and commenting on them.
- You can find another student of your campus on the app and have a realtime one-to-one chat with him/her. You can
personalize your profile by adding details of yourself, as well as a profile picture.
- It provides a platform for e-commerce trade of skills, services as well as products within the campus community
